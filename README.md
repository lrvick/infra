# lrvick's Infra

This repo is there I manage all of the live configuration for my personal
infrastructure.

While this is intended only for personal use, I attempt to provide abstractions
so any of these patterns or modules can be re-used as desired for a wide range
of personal or company needs.

Mostly I am documenting this for my future self, because that guy forgets
everything and needs every little detail laid out for him.

## Setup Steps

### AWS Account Setup

This should be the only time root credentials for the master account are ever
required.

1. Create AWS Organization

    See: [http://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_create.html]

    Be sure and choose "Enable All Features"

2. Enable IAM managed billing

    a. Visit: [https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/home?region=us-west-2#/account]
    b. Check "IAM user/role access to billing information"

3. Activate MFA on root account

    See: [http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_mfa.html?icmpid=docs_iam_console]

    A touch-enabled hardware security module such as a Yubikey 4 is recommended
    to greatly limit risk of leaking TOTP secret.

4. Generate root Access Keys

    See: [http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_root-user.html?icmpid=docs_iam_console#id_root-user_manage_add-key]

5. Bootstrap organization accounts and global users/roles/policies

    ```
    make install
    ```

6. Delete root Access Keys

    See: [http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_root-user.html?icmpid=docs_iam_console#id_root-user_manage_add-key]

### AWS User Setup

Each user will need to do some one-time manual steps before using their
account.

1. Change account password

    See: [http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_passwords_user-change-own.html]

2. Generate access keys (Optional)

    See: [http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html]

3. Configure CLI with access keys (Optional)

    ```
    aws configure
    ```
4. Bind MFA device to account:

    ```
    aws iam create-virtual-mfa-device \
      --virtual-mfa-device-name lrvick-yubikey \
      --bootstrap-method Base32StringSeed
    aws iam enable-mfa-device \
      --user-name lrvick \
      --serial-number arn:aws:iam::210987654321:mfa/lrvick-yubikey \
      --authentication-code-1 123456 \
      --authentication-code-2 789012
    ```

## Usage

### Common Operations

Run "terraform plan" for the "staging" account:
```
make plan-staging
```

Run "terraform apply" for the "production" account:
```
make apply-production
```

### Direct AWS/terraform CLI access:

Provide the desired account name and an mfa token to aws-mfa.sh:

```
source scripts/aws-mfa.sh production 123456
```

Change terraform configuration as desired and apply changes manually with:

```
cd terraform/accounts/root
terraform apply
```
